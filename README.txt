HOW TO ADD PAINTING IMAGES
==========================

To add your painting images:

1. Save your painting images in this folder (images/)
2. Name them as follows:
   - painting-1.jpg (or .png)
   - painting-2.jpg (or .png)
   - painting-3.jpg (or .png)
   - painting-4.jpg (or .png)
   - painting-5.jpg (or .png)
   - painting-6.jpg (or .png)

3. For best results, use images that are:
   - Square or close to square (1:1 aspect ratio)
   - At least 600x600 pixels
   - JPG or PNG format

4. If you have more than 6 paintings, you can:
   - Add more artwork items in index.html
   - Name additional images painting-7.jpg, painting-8.jpg, etc.

The website will automatically display placeholder boxes until you add the actual images.
